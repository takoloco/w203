## Maximum Likelihood Overview

1. Our $\theta$ is $h$. Therefore we can setup our MLE function as: $l(h) = f_{H}(x;h)$
2. $f_{H}(x;h)$'s distribution follows the HyperGroussian distribution. Therefore $l(h) = HyperGroussian distribution function for which we don't details.
3. We will then compute $\frac{d}{dh} ln(l(h))$ to maximize h.
4. Solving the derivative will give you the MLE value of h.
